# FAQ

- **How do I sync my Library accross different PCs?**

Sync is not supported. However, you can set `paperLocation` and `userDataLocation` to a cloud-based directory and set up synchronization within your cloud service app.

- **PaperShelf does not work after an update. What should I do?**

Old settings may not work on a newer version. Please try removing the content of `config.yaml` (in `Files/PaperShelf > Preferences > config.yaml`) and restarting the app.
