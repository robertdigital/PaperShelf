# PaperShelf

## Why PaperShelf?

As someone who does research, I often find myself lost in a bunch of opening tabs or spending time renaming and organizing my downloaded PDF files. PaperShelf is a tool for researchers. The goal of the project is to provide a friendly and convenient tool to browse and organize papers, so that you do not need to have a long list of tabs and bookmarks in your browser. PaperShelf gathers data from different sources such as Arxiv, Google Scholar, etc., so you always get the official, complete, and up-to-date version and information across different sites.
